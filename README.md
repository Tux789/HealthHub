# Description
*HealthHub* 
This is app will allow users to share their overall fitness goals with their friends. Once invited, friends can comment and offer support. 

We all do better when have those positive vibes coming our way, but we also understand that it can be tough to gauge health and fitness progress when we're busy. To solve this, we'll also be coding a simple solution using React Native, so users also have a private dashboard that accurately charts progress for each goal, once a user selects one and starts using the app's simple interface to make updates. 

# Viewing the App
